Your mission, should 
you choose to accept it, is
to restore Love back to all
things.

Love the snow by placing it 
beneath your feet.

Love the grass by taking it 
into your loving hands and 
sprinkling it onto the sidewalk.

Love the guitar by plucking its 
strings. 

Love the drinking glass by 
cradling it within your 
hands, and Love the tender 
juice contained by tasting 
every drop and offering it to the heavens.

Love the freezing wind as it meets your face - as 
you are grateful for its pure embrace.

Love the misplaced items you find by chaufering 
them to a better home.

Love each rock by taking it with you and 
leaving it to bask in the Sun's Glory.

Love the birds by thanking them for inspiring all 
the great music we know.

Love each breath of air, that it may nourish 
your beautiful lungs and carry a song of joy 
out with them.

Love every leaf of every plant by gently 
caressing it - no differently than the face of 
a woman. The face of a child. The face of a 
man.

Love every ray of sunlight - that it may teach 
you, and remind you, of the most important 
lesson above all Truths - To Love.
