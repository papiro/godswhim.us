I AM the recollector,
but not the repo-man,
but if you want to repopulate my coffers,
you can rest, assured that it will be of benefit to Man.
I am not the repo-man,
but will re-possess the factors of your motion
-they were of still-birth-
now unto the ocean,

There were those who were halted,
Bubbles frozen in the window's pain of reality,
The busiest bee works even while the workers sleep -
for some workers are always sleeping,
and in a truant's den is where the
Beat of the Drum
is most needed -
for they know not what they miss,
the point, with every skipping stone
they throw to pass the time,
is a skipping stone they didn't throw
that skips their soul
into a clear and universal rhyme.

You were given Life,
but you still choose
your wife
and accept
death -
You were given the stars -
but traded it like a trading card
for marbles
which were already yours.

You trade your wealth for a downward glance at the poor -
and I had given you Paradise
but you chose the close door.

You have your own paradise, but it
is riddled with lost souls - who tug
your sleeve when you try to sleep,
and teach you the thoughts
which you thought were unique.

Cozy down
little lamb,
rest your gears - and
I will trade them
for the Watchmaker's hand.
