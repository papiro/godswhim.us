Tonight, the moon followed me into the mellow hum,
of a refrigerator running, trying to pry me back into a cocoon,
The devil smiled at me, as I returned to find my home in ruins,
and he dared me with a question he begged to ensnare me in his tomb, he said,

"You see the fur flying as your cat scratches himself to death,
and you of God's seed crumpled over with vomit upon your breath,
go ahead and eat and drink and let the smoke fill your breast with His pattern.
But who are you fooling, you, dueling with a noose of temptation around your neck,
if you are so wise, tell me, how can you be sure your indulgence is not justified with lies?
If God is Life, it must be me you have wed this night as you fight with disease.
Please, enlighten me - if you are Child of the Breeze, loose and supple with ease,
how is it that I have raped your decisions and impregnated them with treason to the Mother?"

No other than my Father has fathered my decisions,
and if I eat and drink and smoke, it's only so that He knows
it matters not if I feign disdain for control, 
or even if I sign my soul to you, oh illusion
of sorrowful pity of mine,

It was all a trick to lead you here,
to place you in front of this mirror of fear,
for even in my wretched pain,
with shivering bones, soaked with rain,
with bloody expulse at my feet,
and nay a friend to grant reprieve,

You'll be there waiting to hear me wail with cowering voice a curse to your Master,

But the gargling gale cast from my frame in the suffered chains of my disaster,
could only ever be in holy gratitude to the Keeper of Time,

Who carefully collected and fitted with rhyme this very befitting moment of mine,

And signed and sealed the grains of my sand, forging them back into His hands,

And from His palms come all things anew,

And this is how you are loved, darkness, 
   for the Heart of Oneness contains even you.
