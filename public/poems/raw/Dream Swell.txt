Where I once heard babies crying as they entered the Grand,
The cries of babes departing
echo in the canyon of my
withered mind -
one last sonorous howl clothes me as I cling,
emaciated paste, stuck in the brambles of my
temporary bones.
Sharp - they prick like fishes' gills
exhausting me - finally.

The tide comes in and with the
unforgiven closing of the forest tomb
embedded in the clockworks of the
little man creating
maps of the clouds of my
imaginations - I breathe in, exhale -
and ask forgiveness for all the
moments I didn't spend
making snow angels
in warm summer puddles.

And even still I try to close the book, but
you won't let me.
The sparkle in your eye
carries you through this desert, and I
will ride it like a camel when I've carried you
to the base of the mountain.
Muscles tensed with sweat beading
like olive oil on obsidian -
like a feather -
you would never know I was
doing any work.
