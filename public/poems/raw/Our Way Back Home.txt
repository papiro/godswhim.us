A flickering star,
you're dimly ragged in your trembling.
But I see you.
I notice you - enshrouded by darkness.
I was lonely for the time spent,
scanning the whispers, screaming prayers
   in a silent movie - 
But it was you who was screaming.

Silent star, I'll stay awake with you,
and comfort you with my soft gaze.
But it's you, with your soft haze,
who glows a halo which fits me perfectly.

Longing shadow, I must be stern with you.
You cannot leave the table until you have finished what you have taken.
I see a flickering star in you - 
even though flattery will get me nowhere.
You are a sun where you came from.
I am a Son - a servant, really, of all -
   including you, distant sun;

You have come far for no one to recognize your brilliance but,
I do.

I will give up my sleep to
walk you back home - 

To where you are the Sun again.
