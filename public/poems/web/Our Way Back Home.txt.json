{"title":"Our Way Back Home","data":"A flickering star,\r\nyou're dimly ragged in your trembling.\r\nBut I see you.\r\nI notice you - enshrouded by darkness.\r\nI was lonely for the time spent,\r\nscanning the whispers, screaming prayers\r\n   in a silent movie - \r\nBut it was you who was screaming.\r\n\r\nSilent star, I'll stay awake with you,\r\nand comfort you with my soft gaze.\r\nBut it's you, with your soft haze,\r\nwho glows a halo which fits me perfectly.\r\n\r\nLonging shadow, I must be stern with you.\r\nYou cannot leave the table until you have finished what you have taken.\r\nI see a flickering star in you - \r\neven though flattery will get me nowhere.\r\nYou are a sun where you came from.\r\nI am a Son - a servant, really, of all -\r\n   including you, distant sun;\r\n\r\nYou have come far for no one to recognize your brilliance but,\r\nI do.\r\n\r\nI will give up my sleep to\r\nwalk you back home - \r\n\r\nTo where you are the Sun again."}
