{"title":"Dream Swell","data":"Where I once heard babies crying as they entered the Grand,\nThe cries of babes departing\necho in the canyon of my\nwithered mind -\none last sonorous howl clothes me as I cling,\nemaciated paste, stuck in the brambles of my\ntemporary bones.\nSharp - they prick like fishes' gills\nexhausting me - finally.\n\nThe tide comes in and with the\nunforgiven closing of the forest tomb\nembedded in the clockworks of the\nlittle man creating\nmaps of the clouds of my\nimaginations - I breathe in, exhale -\nand ask forgiveness for all the\nmoments I didn't spend\nmaking snow angels\nin warm summer puddles.\n\nAnd even still I try to close the book, but\nyou won't let me.\nThe sparkle in your eye\ncarries you through this desert, and I\nwill ride it like a camel when I've carried you\nto the base of the mountain.\nMuscles tensed with sweat beading\nlike olive oil on obsidian -\nlike a feather -\nyou would never know I was\ndoing any work.\n"}
