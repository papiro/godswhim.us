<p style="font-size:15px">Tonight, the moon followed me into the mellow hum,<br>
of a refrigerator running, trying to pry me back into a cocoon,<br>
The devil smiled at me, as I returned to find my home in ruins,<br>
and he dared me with a question he begged to ensnare me in his tomb, he said,<br>
<br>
"You see the fur flying as your cat scratches himself to death,<br>
and you of God's seed crumpled over with vomit upon your breath,<br>
go ahead and eat and drink and let the smoke fill your breast with His pattern.<br>
But who are you fooling, you, dueling with a noose of temptation around your neck,<br>
if you are so wise, tell me, how can you be sure your indulgence is not justified with lies?<br>
If God is Life, it must be me you have wed this night as you fight with disease.<br>
Please, enlighten me - if you are Child of the Breeze, loose and supple with ease,<br>
how is it that I have raped your decisions and impregnated them with treason to the Mother?"<br>
<br>
No other than my Father has fathered my decisions,<br>
and if I eat and drink and smoke, it's only so that He knows<br>
it matters not if I feign disdain for control, <br>
or even if I sign my soul to you, oh illusion<br>
of sorrowful pity of mine,<br>
<br>
It was all a trick to lead you here,<br>
to place you in front of this mirror of fear,<br>
for even in my wretched pain,<br>
with shivering bones, soaked with rain,<br>
with bloody expulse at my feet,<br>
and nay a friend to grant reprieve,<br>
<br>
You'll be there waiting to hear me wail with cowering voice a curse to your Master,<br>
<br>
But the gargling gale cast from my frame in the suffered chains of my disaster,<br>
could only ever be in holy gratitude to the Keeper of Time,<br>
<br>
Who carefully collected and fitted with rhyme this very befitting moment of mine,<br>
<br>
And signed and sealed the grains of my sand, forging them back into his hands,<br>
<br>
And from His palms come all things anew,<br>
<br>
And this is how you are loved, darkness, <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   for the Heart of Oneness contains even you.</p>
