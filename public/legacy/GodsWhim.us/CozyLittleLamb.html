			<span style="font-family: Courier,times,serif;" size=16>I AM the recollector,<br />
			but not the repo-man,<br />
			but if you want to repopulate my coffers,<br />
			you can rest, assured that it will be of benefit to Man.<br />
			I am not the repo-man,<br />
			but will re-possess the factors of your motion<br />
			-they were of still-birth-<br />
			now unto the ocean,<br />
			<br />
			There were those who were halted,<br />
			Bubbles frozen in the window&#39;s pain of reality,<br />
			The busiest bee works even while the workers sleep -<br />
			for some workers are always sleeping,<br />
			and in a truant&#39;s den is where the<br />
			Beat of the Drum<br />
			is most needed -<br />
			for they know not what they miss,<br />
			the point, with every skipping stone<br />
			they throw to pass the time,<br />
			is a skipping stone they didn&#39;t throw<br />
			that skips their soul<br />
			into a clear and universal rhyme.<br />
			<br />
			You were given Life,<br />
			but you still choose<br />
			your wife<br />
			and accept<br />
			death -<br />
			You were given the stars -<br />
			but traded it like a trading card<br />
			for marbles<br />
			which were already yours.<br />
			<br />
			You trade your wealth for a downward glance at the poor -<br />
			and I had given you Paradise<br />
			but you chose the close door.<br />
			<br />
			You have your own paradise, but it<br />
			is riddled with lost souls - who tug<br />
			your sleeve when you try to sleep,<br />
			and teach you the thoughts<br />
			which you thought were unique.<br />
			<br />
			Cozy down<br />
			little lamb,<br />
			rest your gears - and<br />
			I will trade them<br />
			for the Watchmaker&#39;s hand.</span>
