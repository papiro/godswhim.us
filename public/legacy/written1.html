			it’s funny how "I know it" rhymes with "I know shit", everybody knows shit and everybody knows IT / "it" is such an ambidextrous string of letters...I guess I could even go further and say "it" is such an ambidextrous arrangement of organized ink / but I guess arrangement means something that’s organized? Ugggh agonize me won’t you...patronize me don’t you even think about it. </span></p>
