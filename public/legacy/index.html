Welcome to the T00lKit, known as developer.godswhim.us for now.  T00lKit is a web-based application 
designed for educational purposes only.  It began as a personal project to help me keep track of useful
developer-minded web applications scattered about on the World Wide Web, and felt that it may also be useful to others.<br />
<br />
I tried to design T00lKit to act as much like an application as possible, and to be as responsive as possible.
This, of course, drove me to learn more and more about certain technologies which facilitate this responsiveness.<br />
<br />
I designed this site to rely heavily on CSS3, but have implemented "fallbacks" wherever possible.  That being said, it would be preferable to navigate T00lKit with Mozilla Firefox, or any other updated standards-compliant browser.  <br />
<br />
Please Enjoy!<br />
